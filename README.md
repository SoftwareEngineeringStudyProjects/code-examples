# code-examples
In this repository we try to develop examples of solving common programming tasks using different approaches.

# Contributing
Different types of contributions are expected in this repository:
1. API design - describe API for the task, such as public classes, methods, functions, etc. It can be specified as text document (preferably Markdown), or code fragments with comments. Also some test cases are expected (e.g. as unit tests, including some test data/files/...). API is usually language-specific, but it can reference API for the same task in different language.
2. Implementation - implement API from previous step.
3. Measurement - measure important metrics of previously implemented solution. Some metrics are: execution time, memory usage, number of external API calls, metrics related to code size and complexity.

A contributor may contribute one of these, or multiple at once (e.g. design, then implement, then measure). It is also possible to provide different implementations for a design provided by somebody else.

Contributions may be provided via PR in this repository. Also code may be provided via some other means (e.g. in separate unrelated repository), in this case it will be copied to this repository.
