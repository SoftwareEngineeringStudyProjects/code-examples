- **Key Takeaways**: Learn about user roles, database normalization, relationships between entities (e.g., users, posts, comments), and access control.

## 8. RESTful API for a Bookstore
- **Concepts**: RESTful APIs, routing, handling HTTP methods.
- **Technologies**: Node.js with Express, Django REST Framework.
- **Description**: A simple API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on books (e.g., view, add, edit, and delete books). This can be expanded to support filtering or pagination.
- **Key Takeaways**: Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs, handle HTTP requests and responses, and manage API versioning.

## 9. E-commerce Shopping Cart
- **Concepts**: Session management, payment integration, complex database relationships.
- **Technologies**: Flask/Django with Stripe API, Node.js with Express and Stripe/PayPal.
- **Description**: Build an e-commerce web app where users can browse products, add items to a cart, and proceed to checkout. Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Key Takeaways**: Learn how to handle complex workflows (user sessions, cart management, and payments), and understand how external APIs like Stripe are integrated.

## 10. Real-Time Chat Application
- **Concepts**: WebSockets, real-time communication, event-driven architecture.
- **Technologies**: Node.js with Socket.IO, Django Channels.
- **Description**: A real-time chat app where multiple users can send messages to each other instantly without refreshing the page.
- **Key Takeaways**: Understand the concept of WebSockets and how they enable real-time communication between the client and server. Learn about event-driven architecture and managing state in real-time apps.

## 11. Social Media Feed (With Likes and Comments)
- **Concepts**: Complex relational data models, feed generation, real-time updates.
- **Technologies**: Django with Channels (for real-time), Node.js with Express.
- **Description**: A simple social media platform where users can post updates, like posts, and comment on them. The feed should refresh dynamically when a new post is added.
- **Key Takeaways**: Learn about building a dynamic feed, real-time data updates, handling user-generated content, and working with more complex relationships between users and content.

## 12. Task Scheduling System (Cron Jobs/Background Workers)
- **Concepts**: Asynchronous processing, task scheduling, background workers.
- **Technologies**: Celery with Django, Bull with Node.js.
- **Description**: Build a task scheduling system where users can schedule tasks that need to run at specific times or intervals (e.g., send reminders or generate reports).
- **Key Takeaways**: Understand how to implement background workers, use cron jobs or task queues to perform asynchronous tasks, and manage scheduled jobs.

## 13. Microservices Architecture Example
- **Concepts**: Microservices, API Gateway, service communication (REST, gRPC).
- **Technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes, Node.js, Flask/Django.
- **Description**: Break a web app into microservices. For example, one service could handle user authentication, another could manage payments, and another could manage the product catalog. These services would communicate through APIs or messaging queues.
- **Key Takeaways**: Learn about splitting applications into smaller, manageable services, communication patterns between microservices, and orchestrating them using Docker/Kubernetes.
